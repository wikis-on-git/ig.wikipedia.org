{{English language}}
'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] originating in [[England]], and the [[first language]] for most people in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (also commonly known as the [[Anglosphere]]). It is used extensively as a [[second language]] and as an [[official language]] throughout the world, especially in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[South Africa]], and in many [[international organizations|international organisations]].

Modern English is sometimes described as the global [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalenvision.org/learn/8/655/ |title=From Lingua Franca to Global English |accessdate=2007-03-26 |date=29 July 2004 |author=Terri Kelly |publisher=Global Envision }}</ref><ref name="Graddol">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/de/learning-elt-future.pdf |title=The Future of English? |accessdate=2007-04-15 |date=1997 |author=David Graddol |publisher=The British Council }}</ref>  English is the dominant international language in communications, science, business, aviation, entertainment and diplomacy.<ref name="triumph">{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=883997 |title= The triumph of English |accessdate=2007-03-26 |date=20 December 2001 |publisher=The Economist }}</ref>  The influence of the [[British Empire]] is the primary reason for the initial spread of the language far beyond the British Isles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ehistling-pub.meotod.de/01_lec06.php |title=Lecture 7: World-Wide English |accessdate=2007-03-26|publisher=<sub>E</sub>HistLing }}</ref> Following World War II, the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States has significantly accelerated the spread of the language. 

Because a working knowledge of English is required in certain fields, professions, and occupations, English is studied and spoken by up to a billion people around the world, to at least a basic level (see [[English language learning and teaching]]).  English is one of six official working languages of the [[United Nations]].

== History ==
{{main|History of the English language}}
English is an [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language]]. [[Germanic]]-speaking peoples from northwest Germany ([[Saxons]] and [[Angles]]) and [[Jutland]] ([[Jutes]]) invaded what is now known as Eastern England around the fifth century AD. It is a matter of debate whether the [[Old English language]] spread by displacement of the original population, or the native [[Romano-British|Celts]] gradually adopted the language and culture of a new ruling class, or a combination of both of these processes (see [[Sub-Roman Britain]]).

Whatever their origin, these Germanic dialects eventually coalesced to a degree and formed what is today called Old English, which resembled some coastal dialects in what are now north-west Germany and the Netherlands (i.e., [[Frisia]]). Throughout the history of written Old English, it retained a [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] structure closer to that of [[Proto-Indo-European]], largely adopting [[West Saxon]] scribal conventions, while spoken Old English became increasingly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in nature, losing the more complex noun case system, relying more heavily on prepositions and fixed word-order to convey meaning. This is evident in the Middle English period, when literature was to an increasing extent recorded with spoken dialectal variation intact, after written Old English lost its status as the literary language of the nobility. It is postulated that the early development of the language was influenced by a [[Brythonic languages|Celtic]] substratum.<ref>{{cite news |last=Venneman |first=Theo|url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=English, a Germanic dialect? |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= |first=|url=http://opus.kobv.de/ubp/volltexte/2006/697/pdf/tristram_2004.pdf |title=What was spoken Old English like? |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> Later, it was influenced by the related [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], spoken by the [[Viking]]s who settled mainly in the north and the east coast down to London, the area known as the [[Danelaw]].

The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066 profoundly influenced the evolution of the language. For about 300 years after this, the Normans used [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], which was close to [[Old French]], as the language of the court, law and administration. A large number of Norman words found their way into Old English, particularly those in the legal and administrative fields. Later, many words were borrowed directly from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], leaving a parallel vocabulary that persists into modern times. The Norman influence gave rise to what is now referred to as [[Middle English]].

During the 15th century, Middle English was transformed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the spread of a standardised London-based dialect in government and administration, and the standardising effect of printing. [[Early Modern English]] can be traced back to around the time of [[William Shakespeare]].

== Classification and related languages ==
The English language belongs to the western sub-branch of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic branch]], which is itself a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages.

The question as to which is the nearest living relative of English is a matter of discussion. Apart from such English-lexified [[creole language]]s such as [[Tok Pisin]], [[Scots language|Scots]] (spoken primarily in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland) is the Germanic variety most closely associated with English. Like English, Scots ultimately descends from Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon. The closest relative to English after Scots is [[Frisian language|Frisian]], which is spoken in the Northern Netherlands and Northwest Germany. Other less closely related living [[West Germanic languages]] include [[German language|German]], [[Low Saxon]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]. The [[North Germanic languages]] of Scandinavia are less closely related to English than the West Germanic languages.

Many [[French language|French]] words are also intelligible to an English speaker (though pronunciations are often quite different) because English absorbed a large vocabulary from [[Norman language|Norman]] and French, via [[Anglo-Norman]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] and directly from French in subsequent centuries. As a result, roughly sixty percent of the English vocabulary is derived from French, with some minor spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.), as well as occasional divergences in meaning, in so-called "faux amis", or [[false friends]].

English is the primary language in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], Australia ([[Australian English]]), the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Bermuda]], [[Belize]], the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], Canada ([[Canadian English]]), the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Grenada]], [[Guernsey]], Guyana, Ireland ([[Hiberno-English]]), [[Isle of Man]], Jamaica ([[Jamaican English]]), [[Jersey]], [[Montserrat]], [[Nauru]], New Zealand ([[New Zealand English]]), [[Pitcairn Islands]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], Singapore, [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], Trinidad and Tobago, the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], the United Kingdom (various forms of [[British English]]), the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the United States (various forms of [[American English]]).

In many other countries, where English is not the most spoken language, it is an official language; these countries include [[Botswana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Fiji]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Ghana]], [[The Gambia|Gambia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Kiribati]], [[Lesotho]], Liberia, [[Kenya]], Madagascar, [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Namibia]], Nigeria, Pakistan, [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Rwanda]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Samoa]], Sierra Leone, Singapore, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].  It is also one of the 11 official languages that are given equal status in South Africa ("[[South African English]]").  English is also an important language in several former [[colony|colonies]] or current [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of the United Kingdom and the United States, such as in Hong Kong and [[Mauritius]]. 

English is not an official language in either the United States or the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/november/USlanguages.html Languages Spoken in the U.S.], National Virtual Translation Center, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.us-English.org/foundation/research/olp/viewResearch.asp?CID=22&TID=1 U.S. English Foundation], Official Language Research -- United Kingdom.</ref> Although the United States federal government has no official languages, English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments.<ref>[http://www.us-english.org/inc/official/states.asp U.S. ENGLISH,Inc]</ref>  

=== English as a global language ===
{{See also|English on the Internet|global language}}
Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been referred to as a "[[global language]]", the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the modern era.<ref name="Graddol"> |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/de/learning-elt-future.pdf |title=The Future of English? |accessdate=2007-04-15 |date=1997 |author=David Graddol |publisher=The British Council }}</ref> While English is not an official language in many countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a [[second language]] around the world.  Some linguists believe that it is no longer the exclusive cultural sign of "native English speakers", but is rather a language that is absorbing aspects of cultures worldwide as it continues to grow. It is, by international treaty, the official language for aerial and maritime communications, as well as one of the official languages of the European Union, the United Nations,  and most international athletic organisations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]]. 

English is the language most often studied as a foreign language in the European Union (by 89% of schoolchildren), followed by French (32%), German (18%), and Spanish (8%).<ref>http://europa.eu.int/comm/education/policies/lang/languages/index_en.html</ref> It is also the most studied in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world. English is also the most commonly used language in the sciences.<ref name="Graddol"> |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/de/learning-elt-future.pdf |title=The Future of English? |accessdate=2007-04-15 |date=1997 |author=David Graddol |publisher=The British Council }}</ref> In 1997, the Science Citation Index reported that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.

=== Dialects and regional varieties ===
{{main | List of dialects of the English language}}

The expansion of the British Empire and—since WWII—the primacy of the United States have spread English throughout the globe.<ref name="Graddol">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/de/learning-elt-future.pdf |title=The Future of English? |accessdate=2007-04-15 |date=1997 |author=David Graddol |publisher=The British Council }}</ref> Because of that global spread, English has developed a host of [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]] and English-based [[creole language]]s and [[pidgin]]s.

The major [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English include, in most cases, several subvarieties, such as [[Cockney]] slang within [[British English]]; [[Newfoundland English]], and the English spoken by Anglo-Québecers within [[Canadian English]]; and [[African American Vernacular English]] ("[[Ebonics]]") and [[Southern American English]] within [[American English]]. English is a [[pluricentric language]], without a central language authority like France's [[Académie française]]; and, although no variety is clearly considered the only standard, there are a number of accents considered to be more prestigious, such as [[Received Pronunciation]] in Britain.

[[Scots language|Scots]] developed — largely independently — from the same origins, but following the [[Acts of Union 1707]] a process of [[language attrition]] began, whereby successive generations adopted more and more features from English causing dialectalisation. Whether it is now a separate language or a [[dialect]] of English better described as [[Scottish English]] is in dispute. The pronunciation, grammar and lexis of the traditional forms differ, sometimes substantially, from other varieties of English.

Because of the wide use of English as a second language, English speakers have many different [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]]s, which often signal the speaker's native dialect or language. For the more distinctive characteristics of regional accents, see [[Regional accents of English speakers]], and for the more distinctive characteristics of regional dialects, see [[List of dialects of the English language]].

Just as English itself has borrowed words from many different languages over its history, English [[loanword]]s now appear in a great many languages around the world, indicative of the technological and cultural influence of its speakers. Several [[pidgin]]s and [[creole language]]s have formed using an English base, such as [[Jamaican Creole]], [[Nigerian Pidgin]], and [[Tok Pisin]]. There are many words in English coined to describe forms of particular non-English languages that contain a very high proportion of English words. [[Franglais]], for example, is used to describe French with a very high English word content; it is found on the [[Channel Islands]]. Another variant, spoken in the border bilingual regions of Québec in Canada, is called [[Franglais#FrEnglish|FrEnglish]].

=== Constructed varieties of English ===
* [[Basic English]] is simplified for easy international use. It is used by manufacturers and other international businesses to write manuals and communicate. Some English schools in Asia teach it as an practical subset of English for use by beginners.
* [[Special English]] is a simplified version of English used by the [[Voice of America]]. It uses a vocabulary of only 1500 words.
* [[English reform]] is an attempt to improve collectively upon the English language.
* [[Seaspeak]] and the related [[Airspeak]] and Policespeak, all based on restricted vocabularies, were designed by [[Edward Johnson]] in the [[1980s]] to aid international cooperation and communication in specific areas. There is also a [[tunnelspeak]] for use in the [[Channel Tunnel]].
* [[English as a lingua franca for Europe]] and [[Euro-English]] are concepts of standardising English for use as a second language in continental Europe.
* [[Manually Coded English]] — a variety of systems have been developed to represent the English language with hand signals, designed primarily for use in deaf education. These should not be confused with true sign languages such as [[British Sign Language]] and [[American Sign Language]] used in Anglophone countries, which are independent and not based on English.
* [[E-Prime]] excludes forms of the verb "to be."

Euro-English (also ''EuroEnglish'' or ''Euro-English'') terms are English translations of European concepts that are not native to English-speaking countries. Due to the United Kingdom's (and even the Republic of Ireland's) involvement in the European Union, the usage focuses on non-British concepts.  Examples are the concept of [[spatial planning]] {{Fact|date=May 2007}}, the description of something being “degressive”, and the prefix "Euro-". This kind of Euro-English was parodied when English was "made" one of the constituent languages of [[Europanto]].

It also refers to dialects of English spoken by Europeans for whom English is not their first language, especially since English is frequently used by two Europeans to communicate even when neither of them know English as the first language.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

'''Notes:'''

It is the [[vowels]] that differ most from region to region.

Where symbols appear in pairs, the first corresponds to American English, [[General American]] accent; the second corresponds to British English, [[Received Pronunciation]].

# American English lacks this sound; words with this sound are pronounced with {{IPA | /ɑ/}} or {{IPA | /ɔ/}}. 
# Many dialects of North American English do not have this vowel. See [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Cot-caught merger|''Cot-caught merger'']].
# The North American variation of this sound is a [[r-colored vowel|rhotic vowel]].
# Many speakers of North American English do not distinguish between these two unstressed vowels. For them, ''roses'' and ''Rosa's'' are pronounced the same, and the symbol usually used is [[schwa]] {{IPA | /ə/}}.
# This sound is often transcribed with {{IPA | /i/}} or with {{IPA | /ɪ/}}.
# The diphthongs {{IPA | /eɪ/}} and {{IPA | /oʊ/}} are monophthongal for many General American speakers, as {{IPA | /eː/}} and {{IPA | /oː/}}.
# The letter <''U''> can represent either /u/ or the [[iotation|iotated]] vowel /ju/. In BRP, if this iotated vowel /ju/ occurs after /t/, /d/, /s/ or /z/, it often triggers palatalization of the preceding consonant, turning it to /ʨ/, /ʥ/, /ɕ/ and /ʑ/ respectively, as in ''tune'', ''during'', ''sugar'', and ''azure''. In American English, palatalization does not generally happen unless the /ju/ is followed by ''r'', with the result that /(t,d,s,z)jur/ turn to /tʃɚ/, /dʒɚ/, /ʃɚ/ and /ʒɚ/ respectively, as in ''nature'', ''verdure'', ''sure'', and ''treasure''.
# [[Vowel length]] plays a phonetic role in the majority of English dialects, and is said to be phonemic in a few dialects, such as [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]. In certain dialects of the modern English language, for instance [[General American]], there is allophonic vowel length: vowel phonemes are realized as long vowel allophones before voiced consonant phonemes in the coda of a syllable. Before the [[Great Vowel Shift]], vowel length was phonemically contrastive.
# This sound only occurs in non-rhotic accents. In some accents, this sound may be, instead of {{IPA|/ʊə/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ:/}}. See [[pour-poor merger]].
# This sound only occurs in non-rhotic accents. In some accents, the schwa offglide of {{IPA|/ɛə/}} may be dropped, monophthising and lengthening the sound to {{IPA|/ɛ:/}}.

# The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA | [ŋ]}} is a non-phonemic allophone of /n/ in some northerly British accents, appearing only before /g/. In all other dialects it is a separate phoneme, although it only occurs in [[syllable coda]]s.
# The [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA | [ɾ]}} is an allophone of /t/ and /d/ in unstressed syllables in [[North American English]] and increasingly{{Verify source|date=April 2007}} in [[Australian English]]. This is the sound of "tt" or "dd" in the words ''latter'' and ''ladder'', which are homophones for many speakers of North American English. In some accents such as [[Scottish English]] and [[Indian English]] it replaces {{IPA|/ɹ/}}. This is the same sound represented by single "r" in most varieties of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
# In some dialects, such as [[Cockney]], the interdentals /θ/ and /ð/ are usually merged with /f/ and /v/, and in others, like [[African American Vernacular English]], /ð/ is merged with dental /d/. In some Irish varieties, /θ/ and /ð/ become the corresponding dental plosives, which then contrast with the usual alveolar plosives.
# The sounds {{IPA | /ʃ/, /ʒ/, and /ɹ/}} are labialised in some dialects. Labialisation is never contrastive in initial position and therefore is sometimes not transcribed. Most speakers of [[General American]] realize <r> (always rhoticized) as the [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|/ɻ/}}, whereas the same is realized in [[Scottish English]], etc. as the [[alveolar trill]].
# The [[voiceless palatal fricative]] /ç/ is in most accents just an [[allophone]] of /h/ before /j/; for instance ''human'' /çjuːmən/.  However, in some accents (see [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters|this]]), the /j/ is dropped, but the initial consonant is the same.
# The [[voiceless velar fricative]] /x/ is used only by Scottish or Welsh speakers of English for Scots/Gaelic words such as ''loch'' {{IPA | /lɒx/}} or by some speakers for loanwords from German and Hebrew like ''Bach'' {{IPA|/bax/}} or ''Chanukah'' /xanuka/. In some dialects such as [[Scouse]] ([[Liverpool]]) either {{IPA|[x]}} or the [[affricate]] {{IPA|[kx]}} may be used as an [[allophone]] of /k/ in words such as ''docker'' {{IPA | [dɒkxə]}}. Most native speakers have a great deal of trouble pronouncing it correctly when learning a foreign language. Most speakers use the sounds [k] and [h] instead.
# Voiceless w {{IPA | [ʍ]}} is found in Scottish and Irish English, as well as in some varieties of American, New Zealand, and English English. In most other dialects it is merged with /w/, in some dialects of Scots it is merged with /f/.

==== Voicing and aspiration ====
[[Voiced consonant|Voicing]] and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] of [[stop consonant]]s in English depend on dialect and context, but a few general rules can be given:
* [[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]] [[plosive]]s and [[affricate]]s (/{{IPA | p}}/, /{{IPA | t}}/, /{{IPA | k}}/, and /{{IPA | tʃ}}/) are aspirated when they are word-initial or begin a stressed syllable — compare ''pin'' {{IPA | [pʰɪn]}} and ''spin'' {{IPA | [spɪn]}}, ''crap'' {{IPA | [kʰɹ̥æp]}} and ''scrap'' {{IPA | [skɹæp]}}.
** In some dialects, aspiration extends to unstressed syllables as well.
** In other dialects, such as [[Indo-Pakistani English]], all voiceless stops remain unaspirated.
* Word-initial voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects.
* Word-terminal voiceless plosives may be unreleased or accompanied by a glottal stop in some dialects (e.g. many varieties of [[American English]]) — examples: ''tap'' [{{IPA | tʰæp̚}}], ''sack'' [{{IPA | sæk̚}}].
* Word-terminal voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects (e.g. some varieties of [[American English]]) — examples: ''sad'' [{{IPA | sæd̥}}], ''bag'' [{{IPA | bæɡ̊}}]. In other dialects they are fully voiced in final position, but only partially voiced in initial position.

=== Supra-segmental features ===
==== Tone groups ====
English is an [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation language]]. This means that the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[human voice|voice]] is used [[Syntax|syntactically]], for example, to convey [[surprise]] and [[irony]], or to change a [[statement]] into a [[question]].

In English, intonation patterns are on groups of words, which are called tone groups, tone units, intonation groups or sense groups. Tone groups are said on a single breath and, as a consequence, are of limited length, more often being on average five words long or lasting roughly two seconds. For example:

: -{{IPA | /duː juː niːd ˈɛnɪˌθɪŋ/}} ''Do you need anything?''
: -{{IPA | <nowiki>/aɪ dəʊnt | nəʊ/</nowiki>}} ''I don't, no''
: -{{IPA | /aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ/}} ''I don't know'' (contracted to, for example, -{{IPA | /aɪ dəʊnəʊ/}} or {{IPA | /aɪ dənəʊ/}} ''I dunno'' in fast or colloquial speech that de-emphasises the pause between don't and know even further)

==== Characteristics of intonation ====
English is a strongly stressed language, in that certain syllables, both within words and within phrases, get a relative prominence/loudness during pronunciation while the others do not. The former kind of syllables are said to be ''accentuated/stressed'' and the latter are ''unaccentuated/unstressed''. All good dictionaries of English mark the accentuated syllable(s) by either placing an apostrophe-like ( {{IPA | ˈ}} ) sign either before (as in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], [[Oxford English Dictionary]], or [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries) or after (as in many other dictionaries) the syllable where the stress accent falls. In general, for a two-syllable word in English, it can be broadly said that if it is a noun or an adjective, the first syllable is accentuated; but if it is a verb, the second syllable is accentuated.

Hence in a sentence, each tone group can be subdivided into syllables, which can either be stressed (strong) or unstressed (weak). The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable. For example:

: ''That | was | the | <u>'''best'''</u> | thing | you | could | have | '''done'''!''

Here, all syllables are unstressed, except the syllables/words "best" and "done", which are stressed. "Best" is stressed harder and, therefore, is the nuclear syllable.

The nuclear syllable carries the main point the speaker wishes to make. For example:

: ''John'' hadn't stolen that money. (... Someone else had.)
: John ''hadn't'' stolen that money. (... You said he had. or ... Not at that time, but later he did.)
: John hadn't ''stolen'' that money. (... He acquired the money by some other means.)
: John hadn't stolen ''that'' money. (... He had stolen some other money.)
: John hadn't stolen that ''money''. (... He stole something else.)

Also

: ''I'' didn't tell her that. (... Someone else told her.)
: I ''didn't'' tell her that. (... You said I did.  or ... But now I will!)
: I didn't ''tell'' her that. (... I didn't say it; she could have inferred it, etc.)
: I didn't tell ''her'' that. (... I told someone else.)
: I didn't tell her ''that''. (... I told her something else.)

The nuclear syllable is spoken more loudly than the others and has a characteristic '''change of pitch'''. The changes of pitch most commonly encountered in English are the '''rising pitch''' and the '''falling pitch''', although the '''fall-rising pitch''' and/or the '''rise-falling pitch''' are sometimes used. In this opposition between falling and rising pitch, which plays a larger role in English than in most other languages, falling pitch conveys certainty and rising pitch uncertainty. This can have a crucial impact on meaning, specifically in relation to polarity, the positive/negative opposition; thus, falling pitch means 'polarity known', while rising pitch means 'polarity unknown'. This underlies the rising pitch of 'yes/no' questions. For example:

: ''When do you want to be paid?''
: ''Now?'' (Rising pitch. In this case, it denotes a question: "can I be paid now?" or "do you desire to be paid now?")
: ''Now.'' (Falling pitch. In this case, it denotes a statement: "I choose to be paid now.")

== Grammar ==
{{main | English grammar}}

English grammar has minimal [[inflection]] compared with most other [[Indo-European languages]]. For example, Modern English, unlike Modern German or Dutch and the [[Romance languages]], lacks [[grammatical gender]] and [[agreement (grammar)|adjectival agreement]]. [[case (grammar)|Case]] marking has almost disappeared from the language and mainly survives in [[pronoun]]s. The patterning of [[strong verbs|strong]] (e.g. ''speak/spoke/spoken'') versus [[weak verbs]] inherited from its Germanic origins has declined in importance in modern English, and the remnants of inflection (such as [[plural]] marking) have become more regular.

At the same time, the language has become more [[analytic languages|analytic]], and has developed features such as [[modal verb]]s and [[word order]] as rich resources for conveying meaning. [[Auxiliary verb]]s mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the [[passive voice]] and progressive [[tense]]s.

== Vocabulary ==
Germanic words (generally words of German or to a lesser extent Scandinavian origin) which include all the basics such as [[pronoun]]s (''I, my, you, it'') and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s (''and, or, but'') tend to be shorter than the Latinate words of English, and more common in ordinary speech. The longer Latinate words are often regarded as more elegant or educated. However, the excessive or superfluous use of Latinate words is, at times, considered by some to be either pretentious (as in the stereotypical policeman's talk of "apprehending the suspect") or an attempt to [[obfuscation|obfuscate]] an issue. [[George Orwell]]'s [[essay]] "[[Politics and the English Language]]" criticises this style of writing, among other perceived misuse of the language.    

An English speaker is in many cases able to choose between Germanic and Latinate [[synonym]]s: "come" or "arrive"; "sight" or "vision"; "freedom" or "liberty."  In some cases there is a choice between a Germanic word (oversee), a Latin word (supervise), and a French word derived from the same Latin word (survey). The richness of the language arises from the variety of different meanings and nuances such synonyms harbour, enabling the speaker to express fine variations or shades of thought. Familiarity with the [[etymology]] of groups of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their [[register (linguistics)|linguistic register]]. See: [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents]].

An exception to this and a peculiarity perhaps unique to English is that the nouns for meats are commonly different from, and unrelated to, those for the animals from which they are produced, the animal commonly having a Germanic name and the meat having a French-derived one. Examples include: [[deer]] and [[venison]]; [[cow]] and [[beef]]; or [[swine]]/[[pig]] and [[pork]]. This is assumed to be a result of the aftermath of the Norman invasion, where a French-speaking elite were the consumers of the meat, produced by English-speaking lower classes.

In everyday speech, the majority of words will normally be Germanic. If a speaker wishes to make a forceful point in an argument in a very blunt way, Germanic words will usually be chosen. A majority of Latinate words (or at least a majority of content words) will normally be used in more formal speech and writing, such as a [[court]]room or an [[encyclopedia]] article. However, there are other Latinate words that are used normally in everyday speech and do not sound formal; these are mainly words for concepts that no longer have Germanic words, and are generally assimilated better and in many cases do not appear Latinate. For instance, the words ''mountain'', ''valley'', ''river'', ''aunt'', ''uncle'', ''push'' and ''stay'' are all Latinate.

English is noted for the vast size of its active [[vocabulary]] and its fluidity. English easily accepts technical terms into common usage and imports new words and phrases that often come into common usage. Examples of this phenomenon include: [[HTTP cookie|cookie]], [[Internet]] and [[URL]] (technical terms), as well as [[genre]], [[über]], [[lingua franca]] and [[amigo]] (imported words/phrases, from French, German, modern Latin, and Spanish, respectively). In addition, [[slang]] often provides new meanings for old words and phrases. In fact, this fluidity is so pronounced that a distinction often needs to be made between formal forms of English and contemporary usage. See also: [[sociolinguistics]].

=== Number of words in English ===
{{main|Number of words in English}}

English has an extraordinarily rich [[vocabulary]] and willingness to absorb new words. As the ''General Explanations'' at the beginning of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' states:

<blockquote>The Vocabulary of a widely diffused and highly cultivated living language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits... there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference.</blockquote>

The vocabulary of English is undoubtedly vast, but assigning a specific number to its size is more a matter of definition than of calculation. Unlike other languages, there is no [[Language Academy|Academy]] to define officially accepted words. [[Neologism]]s are coined regularly in medicine, science and technology and other fields, and new [[slang]] is constantly developed. Some of these new words enter wide usage; others remain restricted to small circles. Foreign words used in immigrant communities often make their way into wider English usage. Archaic, dialectal, and regional words might or might not be widely considered as "English".

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' 2nd edition ''(OED2)'' includes over 600,000 definitions, following a rather inclusive policy:

<blockquote>It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang (Supplement to the ''OED,'' 1933).<ref>It went on to clarify,<blockquote>Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 [the end of the [[Old English]] era] . . . Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency.</blockquote></ref></blockquote>

The editors of ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]'' (475,000 main headwords) in their preface, estimate the number to be much higher. Both numbers are much greater than the 185,000 terms in German, and the 100,000 in French.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887510957&id=_RDWv9QBJc0C&pg=PA91&lpg=PA90&dq=percent+English+Anglo-Saxon+words&sig=gLUyfm0840gci0_6pgU5j6PxsD8 Adding English: A Guide to Teaching in Multilingual Classrooms / Elizabeth Coelho]</ref> The Global Language Monitor, after combining definitions in the ''OED2'' with those unique to other dictionaries, estimates that there are approximately 990,000 words in English.<ref>[http://www.languagemonitor.com/wst_page7.html The Number of Words in the English Language By Paul JJ Payack, President & The WordMan, Global Language Monitor]</ref> It is estimated that about 25,000 words are added to the language each year.<ref>Kister, Ken.

=== Word origins ===
[[Image:Influencegraph.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Influences in English vocabulary]]

{{main | Lists of English words of international origin}}

One of the consequences of the French influence is that the vocabulary of English is, to a certain extent, divided between those words which are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] (mostly [[Old English language|Old English]]) and those which are "Latinate" (Latin-derived, either directly from Norman French or other Romance languages).

Numerous sets of statistics have been proposed to demonstrate the various origins of English vocabulary. None, as yet, are considered definitive by a majority of linguists.

A computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old ''Shorter Oxford Dictionary'' (3rd ed.) was published in ''Ordered Profusion'' by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973) that estimated the origin of English words as follows:
* ''[[Langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]]'', including French and [[Old Norman]]: [[List of English words of French origin|28.3%]]
* Latin, including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.24%
* Other [[Germanic language]]s (including words directly inherited from [[Old English]]): 25%
* Greek: 5.32%
* No etymology given: 4.03%
* Derived from proper names: 3.28%
* All other languages contributed less than 1% (e.g. [[Arabic-English loanwords]])

A survey by [[Joseph M. Williams]] in ''Origins of the English Language'' of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Origins-English-Language-Joseph-Williams/dp/0029344700 Joseph M. Willams, Origins of the English Language at Amazon.com]</ref> gave this set of statistics:   
* French (langue d'oïl), 41%
* "Native" English, 33%
* Latin, 15%
* Danish, 2%
* Dutch, 1%  
* Other, 10%

However, 83% of the 1,000 most-common English words are Anglo-Saxon in origin. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==== Dutch origins ====
{{main | List of English words of Dutch origin}}

Words describing the navy, types of ships, and other objects or activities on the water are often from Dutch origin. Yacht (Jacht) and cruiser (kruiser) are examples.

==== French origins ====
{{main | List of French phrases used by English speakers}}

There are many [[List of English words of French origin|words of French origin in English]], such as ''competition'', ''art'', ''table'', ''publicity'', ''police'', ''role'', ''routine'', ''machine'', ''force'', and many others that have been and are being [[anglicisation|anglicised]]; they are now pronounced according to English rules of [[phonology]], rather than French. A large portion of English vocabulary is of French or [[Oïl language]] origin, most derived from, or transmitted via, the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] spoken by the [[upper class]]es in [[England]] for several hundred years after the [[Norman Conquest]].

== Writing system ==
{{main|English alphabet|English orthography}}

English has been written using the [[Latin alphabet]] since around the [[ninth century]]. (Before that, Old English had been written using the [[Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]].) The spelling system, or [[orthography]], is multilayered, with elements of French, Latin and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system; it has grown to vary significantly from the [[phonology]] of the language. The spelling of words often diverges considerably from how they are spoken, and English spelling is often considered to be one of the most difficult to learn of any language that uses an alphabet {{Fact|date=April 2007}}. See [[English spelling|English orthography]].

=== Written accents ===
{{main|English words with diacritics}}

Unlike most other Germanic languages, English has almost no [[diacritics]], except in foreign [[loanwords]] (like the [[acute accent]] in ''café'') and in the uncommon use of a [[diaeresis]] mark (often in formal writing) to indicate that two vowels are pronounced separately, rather than as one sound (e.g. ''naïve, coördinate'').

== Formal written English ==
{{main | Formal written English}}

A version of the language almost universally agreed upon by educated English speakers around the world is called [[formal written English]]. It takes virtually the same form no matter where in the English-speaking world it is written. In spoken English, by contrast, there are a vast number of differences between [[dialects]], [[Accent (linguistics)|accents]], and varieties of [[slang]], colloquial and regional expressions. In spite of this, local variations in the formal written version of the language are quite limited, being restricted largely to the [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences between British and American English]].

== Basic and simplified versions ==
To make English easier to read, there are some simplified versions of the language. One basic version is named ''[[Basic English]]'', a [[constructed language]] with a small number of words created by [[Charles Kay Ogden]] and described in his book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930). The language is based on a simplified version of English. Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for [[Esperanto]], and seven weeks for Basic English, comparable with [[Ido]]. Thus Basic English is used by companies who need to make complex books for international use, and by language schools that need to give people some knowledge of English in a short time.

Ogden did not put any words into Basic English that could be said with a few other words and he worked to make the words work for speakers of any other language. He put his set of words through a large number of tests and adjustments. He also made the grammar simpler, but tried to keep the grammar normal for English users.

The concept gained its greatest publicity just after the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a tool for world peace. Although it was not built into a program, similar simplifications were devised for various international uses.

Another version, [[Simplified English]], exists, which is a [[Controlled natural language|controlled language]] originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals. It offers a carefully limited and standardised subset of English. Simplified English has a lexicon of approved words and those words can only be used in certain ways. For example, the word ''close'' can be used in the phrase "Close the door" but not "do not go close to the landing gear".
