'''Arise, O compatriots,
Nigeria's call obey,
To serve our fatherland with love and strength and faith.
The labors of our heroes past shall never be in vain.
To serve with heart and might,
One nation bound in freedon,
Peace and unity.

O God of creation,
Direct our noble cause!
Guide our leaders right,
Help our youth the truth to know,
In love and honesty to grow,
And living just and true,
Great lofty heights attain,
To build a nation where
Peace and justice shall reign.'''
