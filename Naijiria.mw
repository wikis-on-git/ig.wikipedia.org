More than 2,000 years ago the [[Nok]] people in central Nigeria produced terracotta sculptures that have been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name=archaeology>''Shaw, Thurstan, Nigeria: Its Archaeology and early history. Retrieved Feb 22, 2007.''</ref> In the northern part of the country, [[Kano]] and [[Katsina]] has recorded history which dates back to around AD 999. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] kingdoms and the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa.

The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdoms of [[Ife|Ifẹ]] and [[Oyo]] in the western block of the country were founded about 700-900 and 1400 respectively. Yoruba mythology believes that Ile-Ife is the source of the human race and that it predates any other civilization. Ifẹ produced the terra cotta and bronze heads, the Ọyọ extended as far as modern [[Togo]]. Another prominent kingdom in south western Nigeria was the [[Kingdom of Benin]] whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the well known city of Lagos which is also called "Eko" by the indigenes.

Newly independent Nigeria's government was a coalition of conservative parties: the [[National Party of Nigeria|Nigerian People's Congress]] (NPC), a party dominated by Northerners and those of the [[Islamic]] faith, and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and Christian dominated [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) led by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], who became Nigeria's maiden [[Governor-General]] in 1960. Forming the opposition was the comparatively liberal [[Action Group]] (AG), which was largely dominated by [[Yorubas]] and led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]].<ref name=JBS>''Udofia , Nigerian Political Parties: Their Role in Modernizing the political System, 1920-1966, Journal of Black Studies, June 1981. Retrieved Feb 22, 2007, pp 437-447.''</ref> 

An imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while northern Cameroon chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. The nation parted with its British legacy in 1963 by declaring itself a [[Federal Republic]], with Azikiwe as the first [[President of Nigeria|president]]. When elections came about in 1965, the AG was outmaneuvered for control of Nigeria's Western Region by the [[Nigerian National Democratic Party]], an amalgamation of conservative Yoruba elements backed heavily by the Federal Government amid dubious electoral circumstances. This left the Igbo NCNC to coalesce with the remnants of the AG in a weak progressive alliance.<ref name="JBS"/> 
[[Image:Nigeria sm02.gif|thumb|250px|right|Map of Nigeria]]

This disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back-to-back [[military coup]]s. The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna & Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, it was partially successful - the coupists overthrew the embattled government but could not install their choice, jailed opposition leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo,<ref>SUNDAY ORISAKWE, "1966 Coup Plotters Planned To Hand Over Power To Awo, Says Ofeimun." The Nigerian Gurdian, May 5, 2007.</ref> General Johnson Aguiyi-ironsi, then head of the army was invited by the rump of the Balewa regime to take over the affairs of the country as head of state.  This coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favored the NPC, it was engineered by Northern officers, which allowed Lt Colonel [[Yakubu Gowon]] to become head of state. This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence. The Northern coup, which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reasons was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo extraction. 

The violence against Igbos increased their desire for autonomy and protection from the military's wrath. By May 1967, the Eastern Region had declared itself an independent state called the [[Republic of Biafra]] under the leadership Lt Colonel [[Emeka Ojukwu]] in line with the wishes of the people. The Nigerian side attacked Biafra on July 6, 1967 at Garkem signaling the beginning of the 30 month war that ended on January 1970.<ref name=DDRS>''"Background Paper on Nigeria and Biafra, Declassified Documents reference System''</ref>  Following the war, Nigeria became to an extent even more mired in ethnic strife, as the defeated southeast was now conquered territory for the federal military regime, which changed heads of state twice as army officers staged a bloodless coup against Gowon and enthroned Murtala Mohammed; Olusegun Obansanjo succeeded the former after an [[Buka Suka Dimka|assassination]]. 

During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and billions of dollars generated by production in the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]] flowed into the coffers of the Nigerian state. However, increasing [[Political corruption|corruption]] and graft at all levels of government squandered most of these earnings. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subventions to states and precariously to individuals, the Federal Government soon became the center of political struggle and the center became the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government created a dangerous situation as it became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns eschewing economic stability.<ref name=>''Watts Michael, State, Oil and Agriculture in Nigeria, Berkeley, 1987. Retrieved Feb 22, 2007.''</ref>  

Beginning in 1979, Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of [[Shehu Shagari]]. The Shagari government was viewed as [[corrupt]] and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society, so when the regime was overthrown by the military coup of [[Mohammadu Buhari]] shortly after the regime's fraudulent re-election in 1984, it was generally viewed as a positive development by most of the population.<ref name=>''Nigeria, Military Faces Daunting Challenges, AP Press International, March 3, 1984. Retrieved Feb 22, 2007.''</ref> Buhari promised major reforms but his government fared little better than its predecessor, and his regime was overthrown by yet another military coup in 1985.<ref name=Globe>''Nigeria stays calms as leader toppled in bloodless coup, The Globe and Mail, August, 28 1985. Retrieved Feb 22, 2007.''</ref>  	 

The new head of state, [[Ibrahim Babangida]], promptly declared himself [[President]] and Commander in chief of the Armed Forces and the ruling [[Supreme Military Council]] and also set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund's]] Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt, which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing. He also inflamed religious tensions in the nation and particularly the south by enrolling Nigeria in the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]],<ref name= AP>''Michael Holman, 	Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify, Financial Times, February 24, 1986. ''</ref> 

After Babangida survived an abortive coup, he pushed back the promised return to democracy to 1992. When free and fair elections were finally held on the 12th of June, 1993, Babangida declared that the results showing a presidential victory for [[Moshood_Kashimawo_Olawale_Abiola|Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola]] null and void, sparking mass civilian violence in protest which effectively shut down the country for weeks and forced Babangida to keep his shaky promise to relinquish office to a civilian run government.<ref name=>''Bilski Andrew, "Broken Promises" Maclean, September 6, 1993.

	[[Image:Umaru_Yar%27Adua_VOA.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Umaru Yar'Adua]] of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] is the current president of Nigeria]]

Babangida's caretaker regime headed by [[Ernest Shonekan]] survived only until late 1993 when General [[Sani Abacha]] took power in another military coup. Abacha proved to be perhaps Nigeria's most brutal ruler and employed violence on a wide scale to suppress the continuing pandemic of civilian unrest. Abacha was not only brutal but very corrupt.<ref name=>''"Nigeria: Who's who is Military Plots", Africa Confidential July 2001, Vol 42, No 15.''</ref> While Babaginda encouraged his friends, family and himself to steal money, Abacha made corruption a family affair. Money had been found in various western European countries banks traced to him. He avoided coup plots by bribing army generals. Several hundred millions dollars in accounts traced to him were unearthed in 1999.<ref name=>''"Nigerian Lawyer: Abacha accounts apparently in Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, and Germany", AP press, January 10, 2000.''</ref> 

The regime of terror would come to an end in 1998 when the dictator was found dead amid dubious circumstances.
Abacha's death finally yielded an opportunity for return to civilian rule and Nigeria elected Olusegun Obasanjo, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and former military head of state, as the new [[President of Nigeria|president]]. Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as anything but free and fair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development at all levels. This is despite continuing calls for a Sovereign National Conference to discern the genuine will of the people, which the president has deftly sidestepped for eight years, as well as widespread disputes and ethnic violence over the oil producing land of the [[Niger Delta]]. While Obasanjo has shown willingness to fight corruption, he has been accused by others of the same.

==Government and politics==
{{Politics of Nigeria}}
{{main|Politics of Nigeria}}
{{see also|Government of Nigeria}}
{{see also|Federal Ministries of Nigeria}}
Nigeria is a [[Federal Republic]] modeled after the [[United States]], with [[executive power]] exercised  by the [[president]] and with overtones of the [[Westminster System]] model in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature.

The current president of Nigeria is [[Umaru_Yar'Adua|Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]] who was elected in 2007. The president presides as both [[Chief of State]] and [[Head of Government]] and is elected by [[popular vote]] to a maximum of two four-year terms. The president's power is checked by a [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]] and a [[House of Representatives of Nigeria|House of Representatives]], which are combined in a [[bicameral]] body called the [[National Assembly of Nigeria|National Assembly]]. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats and the number of seats per state is determined by population.

[[Ethnocentricism]], [[tribalism]], [[sectarianism]] (especially religious), and [[prebendalism]] have played a visible role in Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960.  Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics and has spurned various attempts by tribalists to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.<ref>[[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], who served briefly as Nigeria's second president, devoted his government to combatting this phenomenon with Decree 33, which banned 81 political parties and 26 tribal and cultural organizations in the name of national unity. See Osaghae, ''The Crippled Giant: Nigeria Since Independence'', Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 57. ISBN 0253211972.</ref> Tribalism and Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as [[MASSOB]], Nationalist movements such as [[Oodua Peoples Congress]] and a [[Nigerian civil war|civil war]].  Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian [[politics]]; competition amongst these three groups, the [[Hausa]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people|Igbo]], has fueled corruption and graft.<ref>See, for instance, Rashid, Khadijat K. "Ethnicity and Sub-Nationalism in Nigeria: Movement for a Mid-West State/Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria/Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria," in ''African Studies Review'', September, 2003.</ref>

Due to the above issues, Nigeria's current political parties are declaredly pan-national and irreligious in character (though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities).<ref>Ibid. See also, [http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html Lancia, Nicole. "Ethnic Politics in Nigeria: The Realities of Regionalism" in Capitol Scholar].</ref> The major political parties at present include the ruling [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party of Nigeria]] which maintains 223 seats in the House and 76 in the Senate (54.5% and 53.7% respectively) and is led by the current President [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]]; the opposition [[All Nigeria People's Party]] under the leadership of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] has 96 House seats and 27 in the Senate (27.4% and 27.9%). There are also about twenty other minor opposition parties registered. The outgoing president, Olusegun Obasanjo, acknowledged fraud and other electoral "lapses" but said the result reflected opinion polls. In a national television address he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2064068,00.html]

Like in many other African societies, Prebendalism and extremely excessive corruption continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria, as vote rigging and other means of coercion are practiced by all major parties in order to remain competitive. In 1983, it was adjudged by the policy institute at Kuru that only the 1959 and 1979 elections witnessed minimal rigging.<ref name=>''Jibrin Ibrahim, Legislation and the Electoral Process: The Third Term Agenda and the Future of Nigerian Democracy.

===Law===
There are four distinct systems of law in Nigeria:
*[[English Law]] which is derived from its [[British Empire|colonial]] past with Britain;
*[[common law]], a development of its post colonial independence;
*[[customary law]] which is derived from indigenous traditional norms and practices;
*[[Sharia]] law, used only in the predominantly Muslim north of the country. An Islamic legal system was first implemented in Zamfara State in late 1999 and eleven other states followed suit. These states are [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Katsina State|Katinsa]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Gombe State|Gombe]], [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]], [[Yobe State|Yobe]], and [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_rights_quarterly/v026/26.3nmehielle.pdf Sharia Law in the Northern States of Nigeria: To Implement or Not to Implement, the Constitutionality is the Question]</ref>
The country has a [[judicial branch]], the highest court of which is the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]].

==States and local government areas==
{{main|States of Nigeria|Local Government Areas of Nigeria}}
Nigeria is divided into thirty-six [[state]]s and one [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]], which are further sub-divided into 774 [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (LGAs). The plethora of states, of which  there were only three at independence, reflect the country's tumultuous history and the difficulties of managing such a heterogeneous national entity at all levels of government.

{{Nigeria states map}}

Nigeria has six cities with a population of over 1 million people (from largest to smallest: [[Lagos]], [[Kano]], [[Ibadan]], [[Kaduna]], [[Port Harcourt]], and [[Benin City]]). Lagos is the [[List of most populous cities in Africa|largest city in sub-Saharan Africa]], with a population of over [[List of metropolitan areas by population|10 million]] in its urban area alone.

==Foreign relations and military==
===Foreign relations===
[[Image:Nigerian_Parliament_House_Abuja.jpg|Nigerian Parliament in Abuja|thumb|right|220px]] {{main|Foreign relations of Nigeria}}
Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made the liberation and restoration of the dignity of Africa the centerpiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid regime in [[South Africa]];<ref name=>''"Collins Edomaruse, HOW OBASANJO CUT UK, US TO SIZE", BY ANDREW YOUNG,  This Day (Nigeria) - , July 20, 2006.''</ref> Nigeria's foreign policy was soon tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war and quickly committed itself to the liberation struggles going on in the Southern Africa sub-region. Though Nigeria never sent an expeditionary force in that struggle, it offered more than rhetoric to the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the racist regime and their incursions in southern Africa, in addition to expediting large sums to aid anti-colonial struggles. Nigeria was also a founding member of the [[Organization for African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), and has tremendous influence in [[West Africa]] and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for [[ECOWAS]] and [[ECOMOG]], economic and military organizations respectively.

With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the [[Congo Crisis|Congo]] at the behest of the [[United Nations]] shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time); Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for [[Angola|Angola's]] [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]], [[SWAPO]] in [[Namibia]], and aiding anti-colonial struggles in [[RENAMO|Mozambique]], and [[Rhodesian Bush War|Zimbabwe]] (then Rhodesia) military and economically.

Nigeria retains membership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in late November 2006 organized an Africa-South America Summit in Abuja to promote what some attendees termed "South-South" linkages on a variety of fronts.<ref>See, e.g., the African Union website, at http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/November/SummitASA/summit.htm </ref> Nigeria is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], from which it was temporarily expelled in 1995 under the [[Sani Abacha|Abacha regime]].

Nigeria has remained a key player in the [[Petroleum industry|international oil industry]] since the 1970s, and maintains membership in [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] [[OPEC]] which it joined in July, 1971. Its [[Petroleum in Nigeria|status as a major petroleum producer]] figures prominently in its sometimes vicissitudinous international relations with both [[developed countries]], notably the [[United States]] and more recently [[PRC|China]] and developing countries, notably Ghana, Jamaica and Kenya.<ref name=>''Shaw Timothy, The State of Nigeria: Oil Prices Power Bases and Foreign Policy, Canadian Journal of African Studies, Vol 18, no 2, 1984.''</ref>

Millions of Nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship to Europe, North America and Australia among others. It is estimated that over a million [[Nigerian American|Nigerians]] have emigrated to the United States and constitute the [[Nigerian American]] populace. Of such Diasporic communities include the "[[Egbe Omo Yoruba]]" society. <ref>[http://www.yorubanation.org/ "Egbe Omo Yoruba, National Association Of Yoruba descendants in North America"], ''yorubanation.org'', [[19 May]] [[2007]].</ref>



===Military of Nigeria===
{{main|Military of Nigeria}}
[[Image:Nigerian troops with US C130.jpg|thumb|290px|Nigerian troops]]

The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country's history since independence. Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history. Its last period of rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of dictator [[Sani Abacha]] in 1998.

Taking advantage of its role of sub-Saharan Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force. Since 1995, the Nigerian military through ECOMOG mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in [[Liberia]] (1997), [[Ivory Coast]] (1997-1999), [[Sierra Leone]] 1997-1999,<ref name=Press>''Ed O'Loughlin, Nigerians outshine the British brass, The Independent (London), March 11, 1998.''</ref>  and presently in [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] region under an African Union mandate. 

Active duty personnel in the three Nigerian armed services total approximately 115,000. The [[Nigerian Army]], the largest of the services, has about 99,000 personnel deployed in two mechanized infantry divisions, amour division, one composite division (airborne and amphibious), the [[Lagos Garrison Command]] (a division size unit), the Abuja-based Brigade of Guards and other regimental size units (e.g. artillery brigade). It has demonstrated its capability to mobilize, deploy, and sustain battalions in support of peacekeeping operations in [[Liberia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], [[Angola]], [[Rwanda]], [[Somalia]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. The [[Nigerian Navy]] (7,000 members) is equipped with [[MEKO|frigates]], fast attack craft, corvettes, and coastal patrol boats. The [[Nigerian Air Force]] (9,000 members) flies transport, trainer, helicopter, and fighter aircraft, many of which are currently non-operational, but there is an ongoing policy of reorganization, and the provision of a very professional armed forces with high capability. Nigeria also has pursued a policy of developing domestic training and military production capabilities.

Nigeria has continued a strict policy of diversification in military procurement from various countries. After the imposition of sanctions by many Western nations, Nigeria turned to the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Russia]], [[North Korea]], and [[India]] for the purchase of military equipment and training.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Nigeria}}
{{MapLibrary|Nigeria_sat.png|Nigeria}}
[[Image:Nigeria veg 1979.jpg|thumb|Map of [[vegetation]] in Nigeria]]

Nigeria is located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea and has a total area of 923,768 [[square kilometre|km²]] (356,669 [[square miles|mi²]]),<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html Rank Order - Area]</ref> making it the world's 32nd-largest country (after [[Tanzania]]). It is comparable in size to [[Venezuela]], and is about twice the size of [[California]]. It shares a 4047 km (2515-[[mile]]) border with Benin (773 km), Niger (1497 km), Chad (87 km), Cameroon (1690 km), and has a coastline of at least 853 km.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html CIA World Factbook]. Note that coastlines, and borders based on rivers or natural features, are fractals, the length of which is imprecise and depends on the measurement convention adopted.</ref>. 

The highest point in Nigeria is [[Chappal Waddi]] at 2,419&nbsp;m (7,936&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).

Nigeria has a varied landscape. From the [[Obudu Hills]] in the southeast through the beaches in the south, the [[rainforest]], the [[Lagos estuary]] and [[savanna]] in the middle and southwest of the country and the [[Sahel]] and the encroaching [[Sahara]] in the extreme north.

Nigeria's main rivers are the [[Niger River|Niger]] and the [[Benue]] which converge and empty into the [[Niger Delta]], the world's largest river deltas.

Nigeria is also an important center for [[biodiversity]]. It is widely believed that the areas surrounding [[Calabar]], Cross River State, contain the world's largest diversity of [[butterflies]]. The [[drill (mammal)|drill monkey]] is only found in the wild in Southeast Nigeria and neighboring [[Cameroon]].

==Environment==
====Environmental degradation====
Nigeria's Delta region, home of the large [[Petroleum in Nigeria|oil industry]], experiences serious [[oil spills]] and other environmental problems. See [[Environmental issues in the Niger Delta]] for more details, and [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]] about strife which has arisen in connection with those issues. 

[[Waste management]] including [[sewage treatment]], the linked processes of [[deforestation]] and [[soil degradation]], and [[climate change]] or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. 

Waste management presents problems in a [[mega city]] like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. Haphazard industrial planning, increased urbanization, poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste [[pollution]] in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, for instance where collected waste is dumped without treatment in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.<ref>D. N. Ogbonna, I. K. E. Ekweozor, F. U. Igwe (2002). "Waste Management: A Tool for Environmental Protection in Nigeria." ''A Journal of the Human Environment'', '''31''', (1) (February 2002).</ref>

In terms of [[global warming]], Africans contribute only about one metric ton of carbon dioxide per person per year. It it perceived by many climate change experts that food production and security in the northern [[sahel]] region of the country will suffer as semi-arid ares will have further more dry periods in the future.<ref>[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/113-8/spheres.html Fields, Scott (2005). "Continental Divide: Why Africa’s Climate Change Burden Is Greater".] ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' '''113''' (8), August 2005. Retrieved 15 May 2007.</ref>  

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Nigeria}}

The currency unit of Nigeria is the [[Nigerian Naira]].

Years of [[military dictatorship|military rule]], corruption, and mismanagement have hampered economic activity and output in Nigeria and continue to do so, despite the restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reform. According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and the [[World Bank]], Nigerian [[GDP]] at [[purchasing power parity]] was only at $170.7 billion as of FY 2005. The GDP per head is at $692. [http://www.economist.com/countries/Nigeria/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet]

[[Petroleum in Nigeria|Petroleum]] plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of the GDP. It is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves and the country was also a founding member of [[OPEC]]. However, due to crumbling infrastructure, corruption, and ongoing civil strife in the [[Niger Delta]]- its main oil producing region- oil production and export is not at 100% capacity. 

Mineral resources that are present in Nigeria but not yet fully exploited are [[coal]] and [[tin]]. Other natural resources in the country include iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc, and arable land.<ref name=Gov>''http://www.msmd.gov.ng/publications/publications.asp .''</ref> Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is almost non-existent. About 60% of Nigerians are employed in the agricultural sector. Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria. Perhaps, one of the most daunting ramifications of the discovery of oil was the decline of agricultural sector. So tragic was this neglect that Nigeria, which in the 1960s grew 98% of his own food and was a net food exporter, now must import much of the same cash crops it was formerly famous for as the biggest exporter. Agricultural products include [[groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], [[cocoa]], [[coconut]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[maize]], [[pearl millet]], [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[sugar cane]]. It also has a booming leather and textile industry, with industries located in Kano, Abeokuta, Onitsha, and Lagos.

Like many [[Third World]] nations, Nigeria has accumulated a significant foreign debt. Many of the projects financed by these debts were inefficient, bedevilled by corruption or failed to live up to expectations. Nigeria defaulted on its debt as arrears and penalty interest accumulated and increased the size of the debt. However, after a long campaign by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement that will see Nigeria's debt reduced by approximately 60%. Nigeria will use part of its oil windfall to pay the residual 40%. This deal will free up at least $1.15 billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. As of April 2006, Nigeria became the first African Country to fully pay off her debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the [[Paris Club]].

Nigeria also has significant production and manufacturing facilities such as factories for [[Peugeot]] the French car marker, [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] the English truck manufacturer, now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], and also manufactures [[t-shirts]] and [[processed food]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Nigeria}}
[[Image:Bevölkerungsdichte Nigerischer Bundesstaaten english.PNG|thumb|Population density in Nigeria]]

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa but exactly how populous is a subject of speculation. The [[United Nations]] estimates that the population in 2004 was at 131,530,000 [http://esa.un.org/unpp/], with the population distributed as 48.3% Urban and 51.7% rural and population density at 139 people per square km. National census results in the past few decades have been disputed. The results of the most recent census by the Government of Nigeria have been released [[29 December]] [[2006]]. The census gave a population of 140.003.542. The only breakdown available was 
Total: 140.003.542 
Men: 71.709.859 
Women: 68.293.083

According to the United Nations, Nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By their projections, Nigeria will be one of the countries in the world that will account for most of the world's total population increase by 2050. [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.htm] According to current data, one out of every four Africans are Nigerian. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5072244.stm] Presently, [[World population|Nigeria is the ninth most populous country in the world]], and even conservative estimates conclude that more than 20% of the world's black population lives in Nigeria. 2006 estimates claim 42.3% of the population is between 0-14 years of age, while 54.6% is between 15-65; the [[birth rate]] is significantly higher than the [[death rate]], at 40.4 and 16.9 per 1000 people respectively.<ref name=CP2006>'' [[United States Library of Congress]] - Federal Research Division. Country Profile-[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Nigeria.pdf Nigeria (2006)].''</ref>

Health, [[health care]], and general living conditions in Nigeria are poor. [[Life expectancy]] is 47 years (average male/female) and just over half the population has access to potable water and appropriate [[sanitation]]; the percentage is of children under five has gone up rather than down between 1990 and 2003 and infant mortality is 97.1 deaths per 1000 [[live births]].<ref name=CP2006/> [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] rate in Nigeria is much lower compared to the other African nations such as [[Kenya]] or [[South Africa]] whose prevalence (percentage) rates are in the double digits. Nigeria, like many developing countries, also suffers from a [[polio]] crisis as well as periodic outbreaks of [[cholera]], [[malaria]], and [[sleeping sickness]]. As of 2004, there has been a vaccination drive, spearheaded by the [[World Health Organization|W.H.O.]], to combat [[polio]] and [[malaria]] that has been met with controversy in some regions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3556777.stm |title=Nigerian state thwarts polio push|publisher=BBC News |date=[[March 22]], [[2004]] |accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref>

[[Education]] is also in a state of neglect, though after the oil boom on the oil price in the early 1970s, tertiary education was improved so it would reach every subregion of Nigeria. Education is provided free by the government, but the attendance rate for secondary education is only 29% (average male 32%/female 27%). The education system has been described as "dysfunctional" largely due to decaying institutional infrastructure. 68% of the population is [[literate]], and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).<ref name=CP2006/>

===Ethno-linguistic groups===
[[Image:Nigeria linguistic 1979.jpg|thumb|[[Ethno-linguistic]] map of Nigeria]]

Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Yoruba]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], accounting for 68% of population, while the [[Edo (ethnic group)|Edo]], [[Ijaw]] (10%), [[Kanuri]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Nupe]] and [[Tiv]] comprise 27%; other minorities make up the remaining 7 percent.<ref name=NGeo>'' Geographica: The complete Atlas of the world, "Nigeria", (Random House, 2002).''</ref> The middle belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and [[Kofyar]].

There are small minorities of [[English people|English]], [[United States|Americans]], [[India|East Indians]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Syria]]n, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and refugees and immigrants from other [[West Africa]]n or [[East Africa]]n nations. These minorities mostly reside in major cities such as [[Lagos]] and [[Abuja]], or in the [[Niger Delta]] as employees for the major oil companies. A number of [[Cuba]]ns settled Nigeria as political refugees following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. A number of them include [[Afro-Cuban]]s and mixed-raced Cubans.<ref name=CIAFB/>

In the middle of the [[nineteenth century]], a number of ex-slaves of Afro-Cuban and [[Afro-Brazilian]] descent<ref>Toyin Falola; The History of Nigeria, Greenwood Press, 1999. pp 41,47</ref>  and emigrants from [[Sierra Leone]] established communities in [[Lagos]], [[Ibadan]] and other regions of Nigeria. Many ex-slaves came to Nigeria following the [[emancipation]] of [[slaves]] in [[Latin America]]. Many of the [[immigrants]], sometimes called Saros (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from [[Brazil]])<ref>Abiola Dosumu Elegbede-Fernandez, Lagos A Legacy of Honour. Spectrum Books, 1992.pp 19,27</ref> later became prominent merchants and [[missionaries]] in [[Lagos]] and [[Abeokuta]]. 

====Language====
{{main|Languages of Nigeria}}

The number of languages currently estimated and catalogued in Nigeria is 521. This number includes 510 living languages, two second languages without native speakers and 9 extinct languages. In some areas of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The official language of Nigeria, [[English language|English]], was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. The choice of English as the official language was partially related to the fact that a part of Nigerian population spoke English as a result of British colonization that ended in 1960.

The major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[African languages]] - the majority are [[Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], the [[Hausa language]] is [[Afro-Asiatic]]; and  [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily [[Borno State]], is a member of the [[Nilo-Saharan|Nilo-Saharan family]]. Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English, being the official language, is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language, however, remains an exclusive preserve of a small minority of the country's urban elite, and is not spoken at all in some rural areas. With the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain tribal languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardized languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is a ''[[lingua franca]]'' throughout much of [[West Africa]], and serves this function in Northern Nigeria as well, particularly amongst the Muslim population. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as '[[Pidgin]]' or 'Brokan' (Broken English), is also as a popular lingua franca, though with varying regional influences on dialect and [[slang]].
The Yoruba language has the most varied forms and dialects. This variation is usualy based on the different towns or as it were Kingdoms that existed before the advent of Europeans. They are as diverse as the number of city states that there are. Examples are Awori, Ondo/Ekiti, Egba/Yewa, Oyo/Ibadan, Ijebu, Ijesa/Ife.

==Culture==

===Literature===
{{see also|Nigerian literature}}
Nigeria has a rich literary history, and Nigerians have authored many influential works of [[post-colonial theory|post-colonial]] literature in the [[English language]]. Nigeria's best-known writers are [[Wole Soyinka]], the first African [[Nobel Laureate in Literature]] and [[Chinua Achebe]], the legendary writer best known for the novel, Things Fall Apart. Other Nigerian [[List of Nigerian writers|writers]] and [[List of Nigerian poets|poets]] who are well known on the international stage include [[John Pepper Clark]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Buchi Emecheta]], [[Helon Habila]], [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]], and [[Ken Saro Wiwa]] who was executed in 1995 by the military regime.

Nigeria has the second largest newspaper market in Africa (after Egypt) with an estimated circulation of several million copies daily in 2003[http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolsoc.html], [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Nigeria-MEDIA.html]

===Media===
{{see also|Music of Nigeria}}
{{see also|Cinema of Nigeria}}
Nigeria has been called "the heart of [[music of Africa|African music]]" because of its role in the development of West African [[highlife]] and [[palm-wine music]], which fuses native rhythms with techniques imported from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]] and elsewhere.
[[Image:FemiKuti.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Femi Kuti]], son of [[Fela Kuti]], is one of the major performers of modern [[Afrobeat music]]]]
Nigerian music includes many kinds of [[folk music|folk]] and [[popular music]], some of which are known worldwide. Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of [[Demographics of Nigeria#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups]] in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments and songs. As a result, there are many different types of music that come from Nigeria. 

Many late 20th century musicians such as [[Fela Kuti]] have famously fused cultural elements of various [[indigenous music]] with American [[Jazz]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] to form [[Afrobeat]] music.<ref name=>''Adams, S.

There is also [[fuji music]], a [[Yoruba]] [[percussion]] style, created and popularized by the one and only [[Mr. Fuji]], [[Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]]. 

There is a budding [[Nigerian hip hop|hip hop]] movement in Nigeria. [[Kennis Music]], the self proclaimed "No 1 Record Label in Africa" and one of Nigeria's biggest record labels, has a roster almost entirely dominated by [[Nigerian hip hop|hip hop]] artists.

World famous musicians that come from Nigeria are [[Fela Kuti]], [[Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]], [[King Sunny Ade]], [[Ebenezer Obey]], [[Femi Kuti]], [[Lagbaja]], [[Dr. Alban]], [[Sade Adu]]. 

The Nigerian Film Industry also known as [[Nollywood]] is famous throughout [[Africa]]. Many of the [[film studio]]s are based in Lagos and Abuja and the industry is now a very lucrative income for these cities.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Nigeria}}
Nigeria has a variety of religions which tend to vary regionally. This situation accentuates regional and ethnic distinctions and has often been seen as a source of sectarian conflict amongst the population. <ref>Osita Agbu; Ethnic Militias and the Threat to Democracy in Post-Transition Nigeria, Nordic African Institute, 2004, pp 6.</ref> The two main religions are [[Islam]] (see also [[Islam in Nigeria]]) and [[Christianity]]. Christianity is concentrated in the southeast portion of the country while Islam dominates in the north of the country; some northern states have incorporated [[Sharia]] law into their previously secular legal systems, provoking controversy.  <ref name=tiptoe>''Owobi Angrew, Tiptoeing Through A Constitutional Minefield: The Great Sharia Controversy in Nigeria, Journal Of African law, Vol 48, No 2, 2002.''</ref>Kano state of Nigeria has sought to make Sharia law superior to the constitution.<ref> [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=15994&sec=36&cont=3 "Kano Seeks Supremacy of Sharia Over Constitution"], wwrn.org, Accessed May 19, 2007.</ref>

Other religious practices include traditional religious belief systems such as [[Orishas]] and [[Igbo mythology]].

===Sport===
{{main|Football in Nigeria}}
Like many nations, [[Soccer|football]] is Nigeria's national sport. There is also a local [[Nigerian Premier League|Premier League]] of football. Nigeria's [[Nigerian national football team|national football team]], known as the Super Eagles, has made the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] on three occasions [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], won the African Cup of Nations in [[1980 African Cup of Nations|1980]] and [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]], and also hosted the Junior World Cup. They won the gold medal for football in the 1996 Summer Olympics (in which they beat Brazil) and have reached the finals of the U-20 World Championship in 2005. According to the official November 2006 [[FIFA World Rankings]], Nigeria is currently fifth-ranked football nation in Africa and the 36th highest in the world. Nigeria is also involved in other sports such as [[basketball]]<ref>AFRICABASKET, [http://www.africabasket.com/ngr/ngr.asp "Nigerian Basketball"], Africabasket.com, Accessed April 29, 2007.</ref> and [[track and field]].

===Cuisine===
Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, is known for its richness and variety. Many different [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s and flavourings are used in conjunction with [[palm oil]] or [[groundnut]] oil to create deeply-flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with [[chilli pepper]]s. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.<ref>H.O. Anthonio & M. Isoun: "Nigerian Cookbook". Macmillan, Lagos, 1982.</ref> 

An incomplete list of examples of Nigerian dishes: 
*[[Amala]] is a thick smooth paste or porridge made from [[yam]] flour.
*[[Groundnut Stew]] is perhaps the jewel in the crown of Nigerian cooking, with groundnuts, tomato and onion as the base, it can be infinitely varied with chicken, beef or fish and different leaf vegetables for subtle flavours.
*[[Draw soup]] is made from [[okra]] or [[melon]] seeds cooked until they 'thicken.' 
*[[Eba]], also called [[garri]] is, like amala, a very thick paste, rolled into balls and made from [[cassava]] (manioc).
*[[Egusi|Egusi soup]] is thickened with ground melon seeds and contains leaf vegetables, other vegetables,  seasonings, and meat.
*[[Aloco|Fried plantain or 'dodo']] is a side dish of [[plantain]]s or bananas fried in vegetable oil or palm oil.
*[[Fufu]] is a thick and very smooth paste made from yams or [[cocoyam]], but any starchy staple can be used such as [[potato]], cassava, plantains, [[maize]]. 
*[[Iru]] is fermented [[locust bean]]s used as a condiment in cooking and is typically added to egusi soup and ogbono soup.
*[[Jollof rice]] consists of rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, onion, salt, and red pepper and a variety of vegetables and meats, and can constitute a complete banquet on a plate.
*[[Moimoi]] is a steamed bean pudding made from a mixture of washed and peeled [[black-eyed bean]]s, onions and fresh black pepper wrapped in a moimoi leaf (like a banana leaf).
*[[Ogbono soup]] is made with ground ogbono seeds, with leaf vegetables, other vegetables, seasonings, and meat.
*[[Suya]] is a meat kebab coated with [[groundnut]]s (peanuts) and chilli pepper.
*[[Sobo (drink)|Sobo]] is a drink made of [[roselle (plant)|roselle]] juice.
*[[Efo soup]] is a stew made from leafy vegetables and tastes nice when eaten with fish. It is common among the Yorubas.

==Societal issues==
Despite its vast government revenue from the mining of petroleum, Nigeria is beset by a number of societal problems due primarily to a history of inept governance. Some of these problems are listed below.

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in Nigeria}}
Homosexuality is illegal in Nigeria as it runs counter the country's deeply ingrained cultural and religious mores. Homosexual intercourse is punishable by imprisonment in the south and possibly death in the Muslim north.

On [[February 14]], [[2007]] The National Assembly held public hearings on a bill to ban gay marriage and criminalize virtually all forms of gay expression. The bill reads as follows:

<blockquote>
Any person who is involved in the registration of gay clubs, societies and organizations, sustenance, procession or meetings, publicity and public show of same sex amorous relationship directly or indirectly in public and in private is guilty of an offense and liable on conviction to a term of five years imprisonment.
</blockquote>

In April 2007, the voluntary Sharia police of Nigeria known as the Hisbah issued arrest warrants against an alleged lesbian who married four women in a large celebration in [[Kano]], Nigeria.<ref>

{{further|[[Gay rights in Nigeria]]}}

===Strife and sectarian violence===
{{see also|Conflict in the Niger Delta}}
Due to its multitude of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria has been beset since prior to independence with sectarian tensions and violence. This is particularly true in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. The civilian population, and especially certain ethnic groups like the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]], have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction, but when these groups have attempted to protest these injustices, they have been met with repressive measures by Nigerian government and military forces. As a result, strife and deterioration in this region continues [[as of 2006]].

There are also significant tensions on a national scale, especially between the primarily [[Islam|Muslim]], highly conservative northern population and the [[Christianity|Christian]] population from the Southeastern part of the country.

Since the end of the civil war in 1970, ethnic and religious violence has continued. Violence between Muslims and Christians  occurred until early 2004. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country.

In 2002, organizers of the [[Miss World|Miss World Pageant]] announced that they would move the pageant from the Nigerian capital, [[Abuja]], to [[London]] in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100 people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after a newspaper suggested [[Muhammad]] would have approved of the Miss World beauty contest for personal reasons. Muslim rioters in [[Kaduna]] killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital. Angry mobs in the mainly Muslim city 600 kilometres (375 miles) northwest of Lagos burnt churches and rampaged through the streets, stabbing, bludgeoning, and burning bystanders to death.<ref name=>''James Astill, The truth behind the Miss World riots: The unrest in Nigeria was more about old grudges than a beauty contest - and it has left deep wounds, The Guardian (London), November 30, 2002''</ref>

===Health issues===
{{see also|Health care in Nigeria}}
Nigeria has been reorganizing its  health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted a community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in  part by implementing user fees.<ref>{{cite web

A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.<ref>{{cite web

The state of health care in Nigeria has been worsened by a shortage of doctors as a consequence of severe '[[brain drain]]'. Many Nigerian doctors have emigrated to North America and Europe. In 1995, 21,000 Nigeria doctors were practising in the US alone, about the same as the number of doctors then in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively-trained professionals has been identified as an urgent goal.<ref>[http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/barticles/brain_drain_the_nigerian_experie.htm Mike Chinedu Anekwe: "Brain Drain: The Nigerian Experience."] ''Niger Delta Congress'' website accessed 8 April 2007.</ref>

===National well-being===
In 2003, Nigerians were reported to be the happiest people in a scientific survey carried out in 65 nations in 1999-2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3157570.stm BBC: ''Nigeria tops happiness survey''], Thursday, 2 October, 2003. Website accessed 26 March 2007.</ref> The research was reported by one of the world's top science magazines, ''[[New Scientist]]'', and was picked up by a number of news outlets. See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3157570.stm ''Nigeria tops happiness survey'']. The report considered that the country's family life and culture were more important than its problems and material wealth in determining happiness.

===Advance fee fraud (419 e-mail scams)===
Large numbers of [[advance fee fraud]] e-mails, known as '419 e-mails' in reference to the article of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud, are sent every day by individuals in Nigeria to e-mail addresses around the world. A typical example is an e-mail claiming to be from [[Mariam Abacha]], who is seeking the help of a foreign individual to move millions of dollars embezzled by her late husband, [[Sani Abacha]], overseas.  The victim is promised a percentage of the funds in return for their assistance, and is tricked into wiring sums of money to Nigeria via [[Western Union]] or other untraceable methods to facilitate the movement of the funds (the money is said to be needed to pay lawyers' fees, bribe officials, etc.). Once the victim's funds have been exhausted, the scammer disappears, never to be heard from again. There are many variations on this basic idea, some involving persuading the victim to deposit forged or altered checks to their bank account and then wire the proceeds to Nigeria. Other common scams involve fake lotteries and fake banks, still others are initiated via online marketplaces such as Craigslist and eBay and involve overpayment for auctioned items.

Many of the e-mails originate from cyber-cafes in [[Festac Town]], Lagos, although some originate from other parts of West Africa or are sent by overseas Nigerians in cities ranging from Amsterdam to Bangkok.  The United States Federal Trade Commission describes 419 e-mails as having reached 'epidemic proportions' and warns that 'people who have responded to these advance-fee solicitations have been beaten, subjected to threats and extortion, and in some cases, murdered'
[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/nigeralrt.shtm]. Educated Americans have fallen victim to these scams and have themselves become complicit in fraud, some even ending up in jail (e.g. John W. Worley, a Massachusetts psychoanalyst who believed he was corresponding with the Abachas and wired more than US$600,000 to Nigeria before he was arrested for depositing fraudulent checks [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/05/15/060515fa_fact], and Victor Whitworth, a Connecticut pastor who thought he was accepting a large donation from a 70 year old convert to Christianity in Nigeria [http://www.africamasterweb.com/AdSense/419%20AmericanClericCharged.html]). In some cases, American victims of 419 scams have been driven to suicide or murder by their losses (e.g. [[Mary Winkler]], who shot and killed her husband, also a pastor, after they became involved in a 419 scam [http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060720-7307.html]). There have also been high-profile victims outside the United States, such as David Maka, a New Zealand politician who fell victim to a 419 scam [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10392100].

The attitudes of the some Nigerians towards these scams are exemplified by Nigerian singer and comedian [[Nkem Owoh]]'s 2005 hit [http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ktz7vc70hZ8 ''I Go Chop Your Dollar''], which portrays them as a way out of poverty for Nigerians and a form of revenge on the greedy Westerners gullible enough to fall for these pitches.  Nkem Owoh, seemingly an actual 419 scam artist, was himself arrested in a raid on fraudsters in Amsterdam in July 2007 [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/02/419_singer_caught/]. However, Nigerian officials have admitted that the association of the 419 e-mail operations with Nigeria is a blot on the country's reputation [http://www.efccnigeria.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=887&Itemid=2], seriously damaging the credibility of legitimate Nigerian businessmen, and have enlisted the help of Microsoft to help them track down the perpetrators [http://software.silicon.com/security/0,39024655,39153344,00.htm], seemingly with limited success so far.

In recent years, the practice of [[scam baiting]] has arisen in response to the 419 e-mails.  Based primarily in the United States, members of scam baiting online communities respond to the 419 e-mails with fraudulent pitches of their own, turning the tables on the scammers in an effort to consume time and resources that would otherwise have been directed towards finding additional victims.  The most public example of scam baiting is NBC's [[Chris Hansen]]'s undercover sting operation for his show [[To Catch a Con Man]], in which Hansen poses as an American businessman who is about to fall victim to various 419 type scams before revealing to the fraudsters that they have been secretly filmed.
