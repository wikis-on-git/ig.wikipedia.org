<!--{{Politics of Nigeria}}-->
[[Nigeria]] is currently divided into 36 states and one federal capital territory.

Before and after independence in [[1960]], Nigeria was a federation of three Regions: [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern]], [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western]], and [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern]]. In [[1963]], two provinces were detached from the Western Region to form the new [[Mid-Western Region (Nigeria)|Mid-Western Region]]. In [[1967]], the regions were replaced by 12 states due to a military decree; only the former Mid-Western Region escaped division, and formed a single state following the restructuring. From [[1967]] to [[1970]] the areas of Mid-Western State and the Eastern Region attempted to secede, as [[Biafra]].  In [[1976]], seven new states were created, making 19 altogether; the [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]] (now called [[Abuja]]) was established also. In [[1987]] two new states were established, followed by another 9 in [[1991]], bringing the total to 30. The latest change, in [[1996]], resulted in the present number of 36 states.
