<!--{{Politics of Nigeria}}-->
<!-- this entire section will be translated before it is shown:
Before and after independence in 1960, Nigeria was a federation of three Regions: '''Northern Region''', Western Region, and '''Eastern Region'''. In 1963, two provinces were detached from the '''Western Region''' to form the new ''Mid-Western Region''. In 1967, the regions were replaced by 12 states due to a military decree; only the former Mid-Western Region escaped division, and formed a single state following the restructuring. From 1967 to 1970 the areas of Mid-Western State and the Eastern Region attempted to secede, as [[Biafra]].  In 1976, seven new states were created, making 19 altogether; the [[Federal Capital Territory|Federal Capital Territory]] (now called [[Abuja]]) was established also. In 1987 two new states were established, followed by another 9 in 1991, bringing the total to 30. The latest change, in 1996, resulted in the present number of 36 states.
