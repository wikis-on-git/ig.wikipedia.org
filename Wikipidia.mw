'''Wikipedia''' ([[:en:IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ˌwikiˈpiːdi.ə/}} or {{IPA|/ˌwɪkiˈpiːdi.ə/}} ({{audio|en-us-Wikipedia.ogg|Audio (U.S.)}})) is a multilingual, [[:en:World Wide Web|web]]-based, [[:en:free content|free content]] [[:en:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]] project. Wikipedia is written collaboratively by [[:en:volunteer|volunteer]]s; its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the web site. The name is a [[:en:portmanteau|portmanteau]] of the words ''[[wiki]]'' (a type of collaborative website) and ''encyclopedia''. Its primary [[:en:Server (computing)|servers]] are in [[:en:Tampa, Florida|Tampa, Florida]], with additional servers in [[:en:Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[:en:Seoul|Seoul]].

hi 
Wikipedia was launched as the [[:en:English language|English]] [[:en:English Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] on [[:en:January 15|January 15]] [[:en:2001|2001]], as a complement to [[:en:Nupedia|Nupedia]], an expert-written and now defunct [[:en:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]]. The project is now operated by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a [[:en:non-profit organization|non-profit organization]] created by [[:en:Jimmy Wales|Jimmy Wales]] who is the co-founder of Wikipedia.<ref name=foundercontroversy/><ref>[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6102279.html]</ref><ref>[http://news.com.com/Wikipedias+Wales+touts+free+culture+movement/2100-1038_3-6102279.html]</ref><ref>[http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-80242-m-61-sc-101-tech_community_to_honor_wikipedia_cofounder-i]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/02/12/bias_sabotage_haunt_wikipedias_free_world/?page=4]</ref> Wikipedia has over six million articles in 250 languages,<ref name="ListOfWikipedias">{{cite web | url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikipedias&oldid=517497 | title=List of Wikipedias | publisher=[[:en:MediaWiki|Meta-Wiki]] | accessdate=2007-01-31 | date=2007-01-24}}</ref> including more than 1.6 million <!-- Do not use {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} here --> in the English edition.

== Characteristics == 
=== Software ===
Wikipedia uses [[:en:wiki software|wiki software]] to allow multiple authors to edit the encyclopedia simultaneously and to archive their changes in a [[:en:database|database]]. Relevant articles may be found by following [[:en:hyperlink|hyperlink]]s from one article to another, in the same way as [[:en:cross-reference|cross-reference]]s in traditional works. Wikipedia also has its own topical organization; articles are grouped into a searchable [[:en:category|category]] system<ref name="WP_cats">{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorical_index | title=Wikipedia:Categorical index | publisher=English Wikipedia | accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref> analogous to the ''Outline of Knowledge'' found in the ''[[:en:Propædia|Propædia]]'' of the ''[[:en:Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', except that it is not strictly [[:en:hierarchy|hierarchical]]. Wikipedia also has [[:en:portal|portal]]s intended to provide readers with an overview of a topic.<ref name="WP_portals">{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Portal | title=Wikipedia:Portal | publisher=English Wikipedia | accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref> poo smells really bad and it is a brown colour and pencils have lead in them

=== Editorial process ===
[[Image:History comparison example.png|thumb|right|310px|Editors keep track of changes to articles by checking the difference between two revisions of a page - known as "diffs"; changes between two versions are shown in red.]]

Those who would like to contribute are encouraged to create a user account, which allows them to create new articles, move and retitle articles, and store user preferences; however, authors may also edit anonymously; in such cases, their [[:en:IP address|IP address]] is recorded as the author name.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F Wikipedia:Why create an account?] - English Wikipedia. Retrieved on [[:en:2007-01-29|2007-01-29]].</ref> Past edits to Wikipedia articles are retained, and remain viewable through "edit history" pages sorted chronologically, making it possible to see former versions of any page at any time.

Changes to Wikipedia are made available immediately on the Web, without formal [[:en:peer review|peer review]]. Wikipedia's philosophy is that unmoderated collaboration among well-meaning, informed editors will gradually improve the encyclopedia in its breadth, depth and accuracy, and that, given enough time, the truth will win out and even subtle errors will be caught and corrected.<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_sociology Wikipedia sociology]", [[:en:Meta-Wiki|Meta-Wiki]], 23:30 [[:en:March 24|March 24]] [[:en:2006|2006]]</ref> Thus, Wikipedia allows almost anyone to edit, except for users banned for persistent malfeasance after a lengthy arbitration process. Similarly, almost every article can be edited; editing is sometimes temporarily disabled for a small number of articles due to persistent vandalism or unresolved disputes among contributors. Wikipedia has not declared any of its articles "complete" or "finished".

As a general encyclopedia, Wikipedia seeks to describe as wide a range of topics as possible. It covers the subjects customarily found in traditional encyclopedias, as well as many [[:en:popular culture|cultural]] and technical topics often absent from such works or confined to subject-specialized references. In addition to the roughly exponential growth in number of articles, the average length of each article has increased steadily,<ref name="WP_stats">[http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm English Wikipedia statistics], English Wikipedia, retrieved on [[:en:2007-01-29|2007-01-29]]</ref> as has the number of "featured articles" recognized for their high quality.<ref name="WP_stats">[[:en:Wikipedia:Featured article statistics|Wikipedia:Featured article statistics]] - English Wikipedia, retrieved on [[:en:2007-01-29|2007-01-29]]</ref> However, significant gaps in the project's coverage remain, and many articles are not well-referenced in a manner consistent with Wikipedia's editorial policy.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check WikiProject Fact and Reference Check], English Wikipedia, retrieved on [[:en:2007-02-03|2007-02-03]]</ref>

One notable strength of Wikipedia is its timeliness. Traditionally, new editions of encyclopedias were released every few decades, as their information became noticeably obsolete. The idea of ''continuous revision'', in which the entire encyclopedia revised and reprinted every few years, replaced this and is now employed by most encyclopedias.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kogan |first=Herman |year=1958 |title=The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |id=Library of Congress catalog number 58-8379}}</ref> Wikipedia takes continuous revision to its ultimate limit — almost all articles may undergo revision at any time, allowing the project to incorporate [[:en:current events|current events]]. For example, the article on the [[:en:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in the English-language edition was cited frequently by the press in the days following the event.<ref>Cited by [http://www.workers.org/ww/2005/tsunami0113.php Workers World] ([[:en:January 8|January 8]] [[:en:2005|2005]]) and [[:en:Chicago Times|Chicago Times]] ([[:en:January 16|January 16]] [[:en:2005|2005]])</ref>

=== Policies and guidelines ===
Decisions on the content and editorial processes of Wikipedia are made largely through [[:en:consensus decision-making|consensus decision-making]] and, occasionally, by voting; [[:en:Jimmy Wales|Jimmy Wales]] and the Wikimedia Foundation retain final judgement.<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Power_structure Power structure]", [[:en:Meta-Wiki|Meta-Wiki]], 10:55 [[:en:April 4|April 4]] [[:en:2005|2005]]</ref> Wikipedia has several policies and guidelines, also developed through consensus, that guide activity on the project, covering behavioural, content-related and legal issues.<ref name="PoliciesAndGuidelines" /> One of the most important states that articles must be written from a "neutral point of view",<ref name="NPOV">"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&oldid=102236018 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view], Wikipedia (21 January 2007)</ref> presenting all noteworthy perspectives on an issue along with the evidence supporting them — thus, rather than aspiring to determine the [[:en:objectivity (journalism)|objective]] truth of their subjects, articles attempt to describe them impartially from all significant viewpoints. Individual edits that contain [[:en:liblel|libel]]ous statements, [[:en:copyright violation|copyright violation]]s, and other content that could incur legal liability or be otherwise detrimental to Wikipedia are permanently hidden from view using a process called "Oversight".<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hiding_revisions&oldid=510980 Hiding revisions]", [[:en:Meta-WIkik|Meta-Wiki]] ([[:en:January 14|January 14]], [[:en:2007|2007]])</ref>

=== Free content and licensing ===
Contributions to Wikipedia are covered by the [[:en:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), one of the many [[:en:copyleft|copyleft]] licenses that permit the redistribution, creation of [[:en:derivative work|derivative work]]s, and commercial use of content. This license allows Wikipedia's editors to retain copyright of their work, but allows others to build upon that work and republish it, as long as the original author is credited and the derivative work is likewise covered by the GFDL. This license ensures that Wikipedia can be edited freely; each author's contributions are recorded for posterity in a database. Larry Sanger has said that having the GFDL as a "guarantee of freedom is a strong motivation to work on a free encyclopedia".<ref>[[:en:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]], "[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/25/103136/121 Britannica or Nupedia? The Future of Free Encyclopedias]", [[:en:Kuro5hin|Kuro5hin]], [[:en:July 25|July 25]] [[:en:2001|2001]].</ref>

Wikipedia also contains images and other media that were not created by its editors, but are in the [[:en:public domain|public domain]]. Other content on Wikipedia is released under different copyleft terms or licenses compatible with the GFDL, such as [[:en:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] licenses. Still other items such as [[:en:corporate logo|corporate logo]]s, song samples, or copyrighted news photos are presented with a claim of [[:en:fair use|fair use]] under the United States copyright law. The [[:en:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]], a media repository and sister project in which many of Wikipedia's images are stored, also allows other copyleft licenses, but does not accept fair use images.<ref>"[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing Licensing]", [[:en:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]]. Retrieved on [[:en:2007-01-30|2007-01-30]].</ref> Contributors may choose to multi-license their contributions under both the GFDL and the public domain, or the GFDL and other licenses, allowing third parties to use the content under any of these licenses.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Multi-licensing&oldid=94110346 Wikipedia:Multi-licensing]", Wikipedia ([[:en:December 13|December 13]] [[:en:2006|2006]])</ref>

Wikipedia's open license fosters other innovative uses and presentations of its content. A spoken version is available for some articles in the [[:en:Ogg Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] format,<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media Wikipedia:Media]", Wikipedia. Retrieved on [[:en:2007-02-01|2007-02-01]].</ref> as the more widely used [[:en:MP3|MP3]] format is covered by [[:en:software patent|software patent]]s which encumber redistribution under a free license.<ref>"[http://www.mp3licensing.com/patents/index.html MP3 Patent Portfolio]", mp3licensing.com ([[:en:May 10|May 10]] [[:enL2006|2006]]). Retrieved [[:en:January 14|January 14]], [[:en:2007|2007]]</ref> Stand-alone versions of Wikipedia such as [[:en:Lexipedia|Lexipedia]] are available for [[:en:handheld device|handheld device]]s. [[:en:SOS Children|SOS Children]] distributes the encyclopedia on a CD ([[:en:2006 Wikipedia CD Selection|2006 Wikipedia CD Selection]]). Published copies of selected Wikipedia articles are also available via PediaPress, a [[:en:print on demand|print on demand]] service.<ref>[http://pediapress.com/ PediaPress] Retrieved [[:en:27 December|27 December]] [[:en:2006|2006]]</ref> A project within Wikipedia is working on "Wikipedia 1.0", a collection of Wikipedia articles that have been verified for accuracy and are ready for printing or burning to CD. The [[:en:German Wikipedia|German Wikipedia]] has been distributed on [[:en:DVD|DVD]]; print and digital versions of the English edition are being planned.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team&oldid=101266668 Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team]", Wikipedia ([[:en:24 January|24 January]] [[:en:2007|2007]])</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Nupedia.jpg|thumb|250px|Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project, [[:en:Nupedia|Nupedia]].]]

Wikipedia began as a complementary project for [[:en:Nupedia|Nupedia]], a free online encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed by a formal process. Nupedia was founded on [[:en:April 9|April 9]] [[:en:2008|2008]], under the ownership of [[:en:Bomis|Bomis, Inc]], a [[:en:web portal|web portal]] company. Its principal figures were [[:en:Jimmy Wales|Jimmy Wales]], Bomis [[:en:Chief executive officer|CEO]], and [[:en:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]], [[:en:editor-in-chief|editor-in-chief]] for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own [[:en:Nupedia Open Content License|Nupedia Open Content License]], switching to the GFDL before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of [[:en:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]].<ref>{{cite news|author=[[:en:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]]|title=The Free Encyclopedia Project|date=1999|publisher=[[:en:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]]|url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html}}</ref> 

On [[:en:January 29|January 29]] [[:en:2005|2005]], Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia [[:en:mailing list|mailing list]] to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[:en:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] |title=Let's make a wiki |date=[[:en:January 10|January 10]] [[:en:2001|2001]] |publisher=Internet Archive |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030414014355/http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000676.html}}</ref>
Wikipedia was formally launched on [[:en:January 15|January 15]] [[:en:2001|2001]], as a single English-language edition at http://www.wikipedia.com/, and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[:en:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] |title=Wikipedia is up! |date=[[:en:January 17|January 17]] [[:en:2001|2001]] |publisher=Internet Archive |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010506042824/www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000684.html}}</ref>
Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"<ref name="NPOV" /> was codified in its initial months, and was similar to Nupedia's earlier "nonbiased" policy. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.<ref name="SangerMemoir">{{cite news |author=[[:en:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] |title=The Early History of Nupedia and Wikipedia: A Memoir|date=[[:en:April 18|April 18]] [[:en:2005|2005]] |publisher=[[:en:Slashdot|Slashdot]] |url=http://features.slashdot.org/features/05/04/18/164213.shtml}}</ref> Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, [[:en:Slashdot|Slashdot]] postings, and [[:en:search engine|search engine]] indexing. It grew to approximately 20,000 articles, and 18 language editions, by the end of 2001. It grew to 26 language editions by the end of 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the end of 2004.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics Multilingual statistics]", Wikipedia, [[:en:March 30|March 30]] [[:en:2005|2005]]</ref> Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers went down, permanently, in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are both the co-founders of Wikipedia.<ref name=foundercontroversy/><ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/02/12/bias_sabotage_haunt_wikipedias_free_world/?page=4]</ref>

[[Image:WikipediaHomePage30March200.png|thumb|300px|right|Wikipedia's English edition on [[:en:March 30|March 30]] [[:en:2001|2001]], two and a half months after its founding.]]

Wales and Sanger attribute the concept of using a wiki to [[:en:Ward Cunningham|Ward Cunningham]]'s [[:en:WikiWikiWeb|WikiWikiWeb]] or [[:en:Portland Pattern Repository|Portland Pattern Repository]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Although Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly-editable encyclopedia,<ref name="SangerMemoir" /> Sanger is usually credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-October/000671.html|title=Wikipedia-l: LinkBacks?|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in a perceived English-centric Wikipedia, users of the [[:en:Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish Wikipedia]] forked from Wikipedia to create the ''[[:en:Enciclopedia Libre|Enciclopedia Libre]]'' in February 2002. Later that year, Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and its website was moved to wikipedia.org. Various other projects have since forked from Wikipedia for editorial reasons. [[:en:Wikinfo|Wikinfo]] does not require neutral point of view and allows original research. New Wikipedia-inspired projects — such as [[:en:Citizendium|Citizendium]], [[:en:Scholarpedia|Scholarpedia]] and [[:en:Amapedia|Amapedia]] — have been started to address perceived limitations of Wikipedia, such as its policies on [[:en:peer review|peer review]], [[:en:original research|original research]] and commercial [[:en:advertising|advertising]].

The Wikimedia Foundation was created from Wikipedia and Nupedia on [[:en:June 20|June 20]] [[:en:2003|2003]].<ref>Jimmy Wales: "[http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-June/010690.html Announcing Wikimedia Foundation]", [[:en:June 20|June 20]] [[:en:2003|2003]], <wikipedia-l@wikipedia.org></ref>

The Wikimedia Foundation applied to the [[:en:United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to [[:en:trademark|trademark]] ''Wikipedia®'' on [[:en:September 17|September 17]] [[:en:2004|2004]]. The mark was granted registration status on [[:en:January 10|January 10]] [[:en:2006|2006]]. Trademark protection was accorded by [[:en:Japan|Japan]] on [[:en:December 16|December 16]] [[:en:2004|2004]] and in the [[:en:European Union|European Union]] on [[:en:January 20|January 20]] [[:en:2005|2005]]. Technically a [[:en:service mark|service mark]], the scope of the mark is for: "Provision of [[:en:information|information]] in the field of general encyclopedic knowledge via the [[:en:Internet|Internet]]". There are plans to license the usage of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or DVDs.<ref>{{cite news |first=Vipin |last=Nair|title=Growing on volunteer power |date=[[:en:December 5|December 5]] [[:en:2005|2005]] |publisher=Business Line |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ew/2005/12/05/stories/2005120500070100.htm}}</ref>

As of 2007, English Wikipedia had over 1.6&nbsp;million articles, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, eclipsing even the [[:en:Yongle Encyclopedia|Yongle Encyclopedia]] (1407), which held the record for nearly 600 years.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedias and Dictionaries |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |date=2007 |volume=18 |pages=257–286}}</ref>

== Authorship and management ==
During December 2005, about 27,000 users made at least five edits to Wikipedia; of these, 17,000 worked on the English edition.<ref>Paragraph's statistics taken from "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediansEditsGt5.htm Active wikipedians]" (Wikipedia Statistics, [[:en:April 13|April 13]] [[:en:2006|2006]]).</ref> Maintenance tasks are performed by a group of volunteers; these include developers, who work on the [[:en:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software, and other trusted users with various permission levels including "steward", "bureaucrat" and "administrator".<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:User_access_levels&oldid=100160162 Wikipedia:User access levels]", Wikipedia ([[:en:January 12|January 12]], [[:en:2007|2007]])</ref> Stewards and bureaucrats are able to promote or demote users to different permission levels. Administrators are the largest group of specially privileged users, and have the ability to delete pages, prevent articles from being edited, or block users from editing.

Vandalism or the minor infraction of policies may result in a warning or temporary block, while long-term or permanent blocks for prolonged and serious infractions are given by<sup><citation need></sup> (or in the name of) Jimmy Wales or, on the English-language edition, an elected "Arbitration Committee".<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&oldid=102764599 Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee]", Wikipedia ([[:en:23 January|23 January]] [[:en:2007|2007]])</ref>

Wikipedia is funded through the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its 4th Quarter 2005 costs were $321,000 [[:en:United States dollar|USD]], with hardware making up almost 60% of the budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Budget/2005|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Budget/2005|accessdate=2006-03-11}}</ref> The Wikimedia Foundation currently relies primarily on private donations, and holds regular fundraisers;<ref>[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising Fundraising], [[Wikimedia Foundation]]</ref> the January 2007 fundraiser raised just over $1 million.<ref>"[http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Fundraising_report&oldid=19190 Fundraising report]", [[Wikimedia Foundation]] ([[:en:January 21|January 21]] [[:en:2007|2007]])</ref>

The operation of Wikipedia depends on [[:en:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]], a custom-made, [[:en:open source|open source]] wiki software platform written in [[:en:PHP|PHP]] and built upon the [[:en:MySQL|MySQL]] database. The software incorporates modern programming features, such as a [[:en:macro language|macro language]], [[:en:variables|variables]], a [[:en:transclusion|transclusion]] system for [[:en:template|template]]s, and [[:en:URL redirection|URL redirection]]. MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[:en:UseModWiki|UseModWiki]] written in [[:en:Perl|Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[:en:CamelCase|CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double brackets were incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[:en:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.

Wikipedia runs on dedicated [[:en:computer cluster|clusters]] of [[:en:Linux|Linux]] servers in [[:en:Florida|Florida]] and in four other locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers|title=Wikimedia servers at wikimedia.org|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed [[:en:multitier architecture|multitier architecture]]. In January 2005, the project ran on 39 [[:en:Dedicated hosting service|dedicated servers]] located in Florida. This configuration included a single master [[:en:database server|database server]] running [[:en:MySQL|MySQL]], multiple slave database servers, 21 [[:en:web server|web server]]s running the [[:en:Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP Server]], and seven [[:en:Squid cache|Squid cache]] servers. By September 2005, its [[:en:computer cluster|server cluster]] had grown to around 100 servers in four locations around the world.

Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of [[:en:Squid cache|Squid caching]] servers. Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the [[:en:Perlbal|Perlbal]] software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page-rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages for anonymous users are cached in a filesystem until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. To further accelerate response times, Wikimedia is building a global network of caching servers, beginning with three caching servers in France. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load.

== Language editions ==
[[Image:He-Wikipedia.png|right|thumb|300px|Wikipedia in [[:en:Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>[http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Main Page], [[:en:Hebrew Wikipedia|Hebrew Wikipedia]]</ref>]]

Wikipedia has been described as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language".<ref>[[:en:Jimmy Wales|Jimmy Wales]], "[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-March/020469.html Wikipedia is an encyclopedia]", March 8 2005, <wikipedia-l@wikimedia.org></ref> There are presently 250 language editions of Wikipedia; of these, the top 14 have over 100,000 articles and the top 131 have over 1,000 articles.<ref name="ListOfWikipedias" /> According to [[:en:Alexa Internet|Alexa Internet]]'s [[:en:Audience|audience measurement]] service, the English [[:en:subdomain|subdomain]] (en.wikipedia.org) receives approximately 55% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining 45% split among the other languages.<ref name="AlexaStats" /> The various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view," though they may diverge on subtler points of policy and practice.

The editing of the language editions is not coordinated, and articles of one edition need not match their counterparts in another edition. Multilingual editors of sufficient fluency are encouraged to manually translate articles; automated translation of articles is explicitly disallowed.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translations Wikipedia: Translation]. English Wikipedia, accessed on [[2007-02-03]]</ref> Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions.<ref>For example, "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation_into_English Translation into English]", Wikipedia. (March 9, 2005)</ref> Articles available in more than one language offer "[[:en:InterWiki|InterWiki]]" links in their left margins, which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. Images and other non-verbal media are shared among the various language editions through the [[:en:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]] repository.

== Reliability and bias ==
Wikipedia appeals to the authority of peer-reviewed publications rather than the personal authority of experts.<ref name="WP_RS">"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources Wikipedia:Reliable sources]", [[:en:English Wikipedia|English Wikipedia]]. Retrieved on [[2007-01-27]].</ref> Wikipedia does not require that its contributors give their legal names<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Username Wikipedia:Username]", English Wikipedia.

Retrieved on [[2007-01-29]].</ref> Although some contributors are authorities in their field, Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published sources.<ref name="WP_RS" /> A drawback of this citation-only approach is that readers may be unable to judge the credibility of a cited source.

Wikipedia tries to address the problem of [[:en:systemic bias|systemic bias]], and to deal with zealous editors who seek to influence the presentation of an article in a biased way, by insisting on a neutral point of view.<ref name="NPOV" /> The English-language Wikipedia has introduced a scale against which the quality of articles is judged;<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment]", Wikipedia. Retrieved on [[2007-01-27]].</ref> other editions have also adopted this. Roughly 1200 have passed a rigorous set of criteria to reach the highest rank, "featured article" status; such articles are intended to provide a thorough, well-written coverage of their topic, and be supported by many references to peer-reviewed publications.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria Featured article criteria]", Wikipedia.

=== Academic evaluation ===

A similar non-wiki project, the [[:en:GNUpedia|GNUpedia]] project, co-existed with Nupedia early in its history; however, it has been retired and its creator, [[:en:free software|free-software]] figure [[:en:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]], has lent his support to Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[:en:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]]|title=The Free Encyclopedia Project|date=1999|publisher=[[:en:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]]|url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html}}</ref>

Other websites centered around collaborative knowledge base development have drawn inspiration from or inspired Wikipedia. Some, such as [[:en:Susning.nu|Susning.nu]], ''[[:en:Enciclopedia Libre|Enciclopedia Libre]]'', and [[:en:WikiZnanie|WikiZnanie]] likewise employ no formal review process, whereas others use more traditional [[:en:peer review|peer review]], such as the expert-written ''[[:en:Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[:en:H2G2|h2g2]] and [[:en:Everything2|Everything2]].
