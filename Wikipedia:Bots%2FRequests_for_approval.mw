* [[user:Byrialbot]] is inactive for more then 6 months. Last edit made on this or any other wikipedia is made in august 2007. The bot was only a few months active. And has made here 46 edits. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 07:52, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

* [[User:Robbot]] is inactive at the moment, but the owner is a steward and it is wise not to remove the flag. That he has still has a bot with a botflag here to do the things stewards do or for undo the damage other iw bots some times do. [[User:CarsracBot|CarsracBot]] 10:10, 28 June 2008 (UTC)
: I agree, nevertheless, the bot is active now. -- [[User talk:Kerowren|Kerowren]]&nbsp;<sup>([[User talk:Kerowren|talk]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Kerowren|contribs]])</sup> 20:09, 27 July 2008 (UTC)
: As a further explanation, this bot is not really inactive, but I usually run it with a whenneeded option. This means that it will not make edits to add just one language, but only if there are several languages to be added at once, if links have to be removed or if they have to be changed to resolve problems. These are all relatively rare occurences, and furthermore I rarely run the bot autonomously, and cannot run it at work, so compared to other bots its activity will be very low. Apart from that, I do not really care about bot flags - I much like to have the right for my bot to do its few edits, but whether it does it with or without a flag I leave wholly up to you. - [[User:Andre Engels|Andre Engels]] 11:27, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

==Global bots==
Hello. The [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] was updated to allow global bots, which are now technically possible. These are trusted bots that will be given bot access on all wikis that allow global bots (the local policy or request page must explicitly allow them, or they won't get access on this wiki). The [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|current requirements]] for global bots are:
* the bot must only maintain interlanguage links or fix double-redirects;
* the bot must already be active on several wikis, with long-term contributions to back up its trustworthiness.

Does anyone object to allowing global bots on this wiki? I'll update the local policy in a week if there are no objections. Thanks. —<small>[[m:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 00:44:27, 27 July 2008 (UTC)</small>

: The problem with having global bots is that, with there being so many of them, this wiki's bot quota will quickly fill up, creating an influx of locally unregistered bots for a small article space. I think it might be best to hold off on opening that particular door just yet, at least until we reach the 1000 articles range. -- [[User talk:Kerowren|Kerowren]]&nbsp;<sup>([[User talk:Kerowren|talk]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Kerowren|contribs]])</sup> 20:20, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

:: Okay. —<small>[[m:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 19:35:41, 04 August 2008 (UTC)</small>

:Just to be sure: by locally unregistered bots, do you mean they didn't create their accounts locally, or you're afraid their edits will be visible in the Recent Changes (they won't)?. Best regards, [[User:Malafaya|Malafaya]] 22:29, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
